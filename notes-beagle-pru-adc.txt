Notes on using ADC with PRU.

1. Starting with 
init_adc() and read_adc(chan) from
/usr/lib/ti/pru-software-support-package/examples/am335x/PRU_ADC

which are added to main_pru0.c

2. changed code to read from channels 0 to 3.

Using read_adc(0) seem to get multiple channels.
maybe need to disable other channels so it doesn't get in FIFO?


not consistent, reading chan 0 to 3 instead of just 0...

Need to empty FIFO?


With Chan0=1.8, and Chan 1=0.0, get:
fff        0      83b      636      fff        0      63b      602 
or 
 0      fff        0      83a      627      fff        0      639      5fb    
With Chan0=0 and Chan 1=1.8, get:
fff        0      fff      f9a      96b        0      fff      f98 
or
fff        0      fff      f9d      96d        0      fff      f97      baf  

3. Are STEPENABLE ever set to zero? Maybe extra channels are turned on?
   ADC_TSC.STEPENABLE_bit.STEP1 
Add reset of STEPENABLE to init_adc()?
#include <sys_tscAdcSs.h>  // touch screen A/D?
/usr/lib/ti/pru-software-support-package/include
added:
ADC_TSC.STEPENABLE = ADC_TSC.STEPENABLE & 0xfffe0000;

Still reads 4 channels...

Maybe runs anyway?

4. in init_adc(), set each step to point to chan 0.
